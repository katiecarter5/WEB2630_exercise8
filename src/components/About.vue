    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Katie Carter! I am a student at Weber State University studying Web UX Design.</p>

<p>I live in West Haven with my hotty of a husband Devin. We'll have been married two years this August. I am originally from Las Vegas, Nevada. For the people that want to know if I grew up in a casino, my answer is of course! Just kidding. I grew up in a normal home in a suburb about 20 mintues from the strip- give or take depending on traffic. </p>
